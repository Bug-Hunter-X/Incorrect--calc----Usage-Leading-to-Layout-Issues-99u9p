The issue is resolved by ensuring the percentage value within the `calc()` function is relative to a properly sized parent container.  If the percentage is relative to the viewport, use `vw` or `vh` units instead.

Here's the corrected CSS in `bugSolution.css`:
```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
  border: 1px solid black; 
}

.inner {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;  /*This padding is now correctly calculated relative to the container width*/
}
```
The `container` now explicitly defines its width which allows the percentage in `calc()` within `inner` to correctly subtract from the container's width.
